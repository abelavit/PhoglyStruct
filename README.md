# PhoglyStruct

Code Usages

The codes in this repository are in two categories. 
One is based on commercial software (Matlab), while the other on non-commercial software (Octave).
In both the categories, one has the option to either train multilayer preceptron on WEKA based on train and test data used for implementing the PhoglyStruct classifier or generate a new set of train and test dataset and carry out the training process of multilayer preceptron on WEKA. Checking the performance of other methods (CKSAAP_PhoglySite and Phogly-PseAAC) against the same test set is available in both the options.

1. Commercial software (Matlab)

Option 1: Same train and test sets as PhoglyStruct classifier
 
Option 2: Different train and test sets as PhoglyStruct classifier

Please run the .m file named 'New_Test_and_Train'. This will generate new arff files for train and test dataset. Next, execute the .m file named 'CKSAAP'. The arff files generated by the two methods (our method and CKSAAP_PhoglySite method) are then used to train the MLP on WEKA. Finally, the same newly generated test dataset is compared against the Phogly_PseAAC method. To carry this out, please execute the .m file named 'Phogly_PseAAC'.

Please see details on training MLP on WEKA at the end of this document.
     

2. Non-commercial software (Octave)

Option 1: Same train and test sets as PhoglyStruct classifier
 
Option 2: Different train and test sets as PhoglyStruct classifier

WEKA details:

10-fold cross-validation of our method and CKSAAP_PhoglySite method is carried out using the arff files. The WEKA version 3.8.2 was used in this work. On WEKA, open file to train and on the classifier tab, choose MultilayerPerceptron under functions. Supply the corresponding test set. Please also choose csv format for output predictions under 'more options'. Use the confusion matrix to calculate the performance metrics sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy and mcc. For calculating AUC, copy and paste the predictions on test set into a txt file.
