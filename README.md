# PhoglyStruct

Code Usages

The codes in this repository are in two categories. 
One is based on commercial software (Matlab), while the other on non-commercial software (Octave).
In both the categories, one has the option to either train multilayer preceptron on WEKA based on train and test data used for implementing the PhoglyStruct classifier or generate a new set of train and test dataset and carry out the training process of multilayer preceptron on WEKA. Checking the performance of other methods (CKSAAP_PhoglySite and Phogly-PseAAC) against the same test set is available in both the options.

1. Commercial software (Matlab)

Option 1: Same train and test sets as PhoglyStruct classifier
 
Option 2: Different train and test sets as PhoglyStruct classifier

2. Non-commercial software (Octave)

Option 1: Same train and test sets as PhoglyStruct classifier
 
Option 2: Different train and test sets as PhoglyStruct classifier
